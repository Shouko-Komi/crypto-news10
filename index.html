    <section>
        <p>The <strong>Thailand International Digital Business & Finance Center (TIDC)</strong> has announced the appointment of <strong>Movement Labs co-founder Rushi Manche</strong> and <strong>Dao5 founder Tekin Salimi</strong> as advisors. Their expertise in blockchain technology and digital finance is expected to drive Thailand’s crypto innovation and financial sector transformation.</p>
        
        <p>According to <em>Kaohoon International</em>, <strong>Wai Man Raymond Chu</strong>, Director of the TIDC, emphasized that their inclusion marks a significant step in fostering blockchain adoption and strengthening Thailand’s digital economy. This move aligns with the nation’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a major player in digital finance.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Roles of the New Advisors</h2>
        <p>Salimi, the founder of Dao5, will contribute by guiding Thailand in positioning itself as a <strong>regional hub for blockchain investment</strong>. His role includes shaping policies and regulatory frameworks that integrate blockchain technology into Thailand’s financial sector in a secure and sustainable manner.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs, will focus on building a <strong>secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure</strong>. His expertise in blockchain security and smart contract programming will play a key role in advancing Thailand’s financial ecosystem and protecting it from cybersecurity threats.</p>
        
        <h2>Potential Collaboration with Elon Musk’s DOGE</h2>
        <p>A notable aspect of Manche’s involvement is his work with Movement Labs, which is currently in discussions with <strong>Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</strong>. The TIDC anticipates leveraging Movement Labs’ developments with DOGE to <strong>enhance transparency</strong> and <strong>reduce costs</strong> in Thai government operations.</p>
        
        <h2>Thailand’s Vision for a Crypto Hub</h2>
        <p>The TIDC’s mission is to establish Thailand as a <strong>leader in blockchain innovation</strong>, attracting businesses, creating job opportunities, and promoting financial inclusion.</p>
        
        <p>In line with this goal, Thailand has been actively exploring <strong>pro-crypto initiatives</strong>. On February 3, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission announced the development of a <strong>DLT-based trading platform</strong>, enabling securities firms to participate in digital token markets.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, Thailand’s former Prime Minister, <strong>Thaksin Shinawatra</strong>, has long advocated for cryptocurrency adoption. He has encouraged the government to adopt a <strong>pro-crypto stance</strong> and proposed the launch of a <strong>crypto sandbox in Phuket</strong> to facilitate blockchain experimentation and integration.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>With the addition of crypto leaders as advisors, Thailand is taking a strategic step toward strengthening its digital finance landscape. The country’s commitment to blockchain technology and regulatory innovation could pave the way for a thriving crypto ecosystem.</p>
